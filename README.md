# 🧠 Employee Burnout Analysis and Prediction

This project aims to analyze employee data and **predict burnout levels** using machine learning models. It was completed as part of the **AI-ML Internship by IBM Edunet**.

## 📌 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of employee burnout based on various features such as work-from-home setup, resource allocation, and mental fatigue scores.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

* **Total Records:** 22,750
  
* **Features Used:**
  * Employee ID
  * Date of Joining
  * Gender
  * Company Type
  * WFH Setup Available
  * Designation
  * Resource Allocation
  * Mental Fatigue Score
  * Burn Rate (Target Variable)

> The dataset is a `.csv` file and was used for both training and testing purposes.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* **Python** for scripting and model development
  
* **Libraries:**
  * **Pandas** – for data analysis and manipulation
  * **NumPy** – for numerical operations
  * **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
  * **Scikit-learn** – for model training (classification)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository:

Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GundugolluMVALakshmi/Employee_Burnout_Analysis.git
````

### 2. Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have **Python** installed. Then, install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### 3. Run the Project:

After installing the dependencies, open the **Jupyter Notebook** file (`employee_burnout_analysis.ipynb`) to see the detailed analysis, data preprocessing steps, and model training.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Building (train-test split, fitting)
4. Accuracy Evaluation
5. Burnout Prediction

---

## ✅ Outcomes

* Identified key factors influencing employee burnout.
* Achieved decent prediction accuracy using simple models.
* Visualized burnout trends across various factors (Designation, Gender, WFH Setup etc.)

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Implement advanced models like **XGBoost** or **SVM**.
* Add more features like **employee satisfaction**, **work hours**, etc.
* Deploy the model using **cloud platforms** for real-time prediction.
